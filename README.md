### Hi there 👋, I'm Jon

I'm a full-stack developer with a passion for building fully-fledged applications. Here's a bit about me:

- 🔭 I’m working a web application for Kitesurfers, using ReactJS/NextJS on the Frontend and NestJS on the Backend.
- 🌱 I’m currently enhancing my frontend expertise, diving into caching strategies and architectural patterns, alongside studying backend design for robust system structures.
- 2️⃣ Embracing the fundamentals: I'm on a journey to learn C as my next programming milestone to fortify my foundations.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open-source projects that make a difference.
- 💡 I’m eager to collaborate on projects that integrate AI advancements into web technologies.
- 💬 Ask me about frontend frameworks, backend solutions, and database optimization.
- ⚡ Escaping the IDE: When I'm not coding, I recharge by hiking up peaks or riding the waves with my kitesurf.
